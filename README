This is a minimal Django project setup to use ep.io.

You will need to generate an epio application name
and store it in 'myproject/.epio-app'.

$ print -n "appname" > myproject/.epio-app

Also you will need to generate a SECRET_KEY for your
Django project and store it in myproject/settings.py

https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#secret-key

You can do it via Python by following the instruction here:

Or you can do it online.

Have fun!
